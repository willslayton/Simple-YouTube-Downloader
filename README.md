# Simple-YouTube-Downloader
A script to download YouTube videos using the pytube and ffmpeg packages.

### Requires pytube, ffmpeg for Python 3 (tested using version 3.8.2)
The script is just a simple prompt for now, asks user for the URL of the video and fetches each stream quality for that video and again asks the user for which quality (i.e. 720p60) they would like. Simple implementation of error handling but nothing to check user input yet.
